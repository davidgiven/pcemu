This is a current list of bugs/misfeatures (not counting programs
which wouldn't run because of unimplemented functions/features)


1.  keyb reverses keystrokes when they are typed quickly.
    Not sure if this is my emulator at fault or keyb - investigating it...

2.  mfs.c has bugs in it. I've fixed a couple of the more obvious
    ones, but it occasinally crashes a bit when running xtree. (the
    logged drive had to be disconnected and reconnnected again to cure
    the problem)

3.  MSDOS 5 dosshell program refuses to switch tasks - claiming there
    is insufficient disk space. MSDOS 6 dosshell has no problem with this.
    Both MSDOS 5 and MSDOS 6 cause an invalid opcode to be executed when
    run on a monochrome screen.
        

4.  MSDOS very occasionally hangs with 'stack overflow' if network
    load is heavy and lots of keys are pressed at once. 

    Increasing the 'stacks=' line in the config.sys file can help this
    problem.


This list is almost certainly not complete.
