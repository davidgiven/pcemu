Speeded up BIOS printing by buffering write requests which occured within a
short space of time. Result is a dramatic increase in speed (particularly
for slow X terminals) when doing directory listings etc.

Added kludge to support vga 50 line mode. This will be redone when/if font
changes are fully supported. For now, it uses the same font, but simply
changes the window size to accomodate the larger screen area. Switching to
50 line mode can either be accomplished by loading ansi.sys in the
config.sys file and then using 'mode con lines=50', or by using the program
'vga50.com' in the programs directory. You can type 'mode co80' to return
to the normal 80x25 display...

Added ability to change compile time options via the Makefile
Added support for a .pcemurc file to read various parameters at run time

Added dumpdisk.{exe,c} for people without access to a Unix floppy disk so they
can create a disk image

Improved support for Sun type 4 keyboards. Made Meta equivalent to Alt key

Added support for Int 0x10 function 0x1b which many programs call. A lot of
the information it returns it a bit dubious, but it means ansi.sys no
longer minds switching into 50 line mode

Made control-break clear the keyboard buffer

Altered the directory stuff in mfs.c to try to make it more portable

Fixed silly bug where caps lock was being treated as shift lock.
