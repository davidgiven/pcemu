Installation of the EMS driver....

Copy the files ems.c, patch.script and *.patch into the pcemu source 
directory.  Execute the patch.script file.  If you don't have "patch" on
your machine you'll have to edit the source files manually. Remake the 
'pcemu' executable.  

Copy the 'EKEMM.SYS' file to your boot drive/file. and add a line to
your config.sys 'DEVICE=EKEMM.SYS'

That's all there is to it.  Report any problems to me.
